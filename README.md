# SoundKey Application for "Loup Garou" Game

## Overview

The SoundKey Application is a PowerShell script tailored for enhancing the gaming experience, specifically designed to add atmospheric sounds to the "Loup Garou" game. By allowing the game master to trigger sound effects through keyboard inputs, this tool enriches the narrative and interaction during gameplay. it is also ideal for custom soundboards, interactive audio projects, or adding atmosphere to tabletop RPGs as a game masterâ€™s tool.

## Features

- **Customizable Keyboard Mapping:** Adapt the script to different keyboard layouts (e.g., QWERTY) by modifying the global `$keys` variable.
- **Special Key Uses:** 
  - `Escape` (Esc) key to immediately stop all playing sounds, useful for quickly muting all effects when needed.
  - `Delete` key to stop all sounds and exit the script safely.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need:
- Windows operating system with PowerShell 5.1 or later.
- Sound files named according to a specific format (`XXX_name (Y).ext` where `XXX` is a group identifier, `name` is a descriptive name, and `(Y)` is the sound index within the group).

## File Naming Convention

Ensure your sound files are named following the pattern `XXX_name (Y).wav` or `XXX_name (Y).mp3`:
- `XXX`: Three-digit identifier that determines the order which sound groups are accessed via the keyboard.
- `name`: Descriptive name of the sound list.
- `(Y)`: Index number within the sound group that determines the order of the sounds when played.

### Examples

- `001_Howl (1).wav` - First sound in the 'Howl' sound group for the Werewolf game.
- `002_Village (1).mp3` - Ambient village sound, enhancing the game setting.
- `003_Nightfall (1).wav` - Sound for nightfall, signaling a shift in the game phase.
